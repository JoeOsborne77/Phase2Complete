# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem
- User wants to manage their time more efficiently
- User wants to be given an estimate of reading time for given amount of text 
- Calculation should be based 200 words per minute

## 2. Design the Method Signature

# calculate_reading_time is the name of the method
# words is the amount of words the user wants to read

calculate_reading_time(num_of_words)
return num_of_words / 200 = minutes

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

calculate_reading_time(800) => 4
calculate_reading_time(1000) => 5
calculate_reading_time(200) => 1
calculate_reading_time(20000) => 100
calculate_reading_time("") throws an error
calculate_reading_time(nil)) throws an error
calculate_reading_time("Hi!") throws an error


_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
