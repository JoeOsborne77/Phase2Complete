# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

- User wants to check whether a text includes the string 'TODO'

## 2. Design the Method Signature

`text_checker(text)` - method name and parameter
text.match(/TODO/) 

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

"Hello my name is Joe" => false
"Hello my name is Joe and I have an extensive TODO list" => true


## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
